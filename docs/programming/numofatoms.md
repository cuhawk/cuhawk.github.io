# Number Of Atoms

Given a string formula representing a chemical formula, return the count of each atom.

The atomic element always starts with an uppercase character, then zero or more lowercase letters, representing the name.

One or more digits representing that element's count may follow if the count is greater than 1. If the count is 1, no digits will follow.

For example, "H2O" and "H2O2" are possible, but "H1O2" is impossible.
Two formulas are concatenated together to produce another formula.

For example, "H2O2He3Mg4" is also a formula.
A formula placed in parentheses, and a count (optionally added) is also a formula.

For example, "(H2O2)" and "(H2O2)3" are formulas.
Return the count of all elements as a string in the following form: the first name (in sorted order), followed by its count (if that count is more than 1), followed by the second name (in sorted order), followed by its count (if that count is more than 1), and so on.

The test cases are generated so that all the values in the output fit in a 32-bit integer.

Overview

In this problem, we are given a string formula, which represents a valid chemical formula. The formula follows certain rules, as mentioned in the problem description. We are supposed to return the count of each atom in the formula.

An atom contains a UPPERCASE letter followed by zero or more lowercase letters.

Since the problem revolves around formula, let's dissect the formula and understand what it contains.

A formula can contain the following

UPPERCASE LETTER: A, B ... Z. Let's denote the group as U.

lowercase letter: a, b ... z. Let's denote the group as L.

Digits: 0, 1 ... 9. Let's denote the group as D.

Left Parenthesis: (

Right Parenthesis: )

Can we have L followed by D?
Yes, the formula can contain a lowercase letter followed by a digit.

Can we have D followed by L?
No, the formula cannot contain a digit followed by a lowercase letter. An atom begins with a UPPERCASE letter.

Hence, only certain groups can be followed by certain groups. Let's summarise it in a table. The (row, column) of this table comments on whether the group in the row can be followed by the group in the column, and further explains the significance of the combination.

U L D ( )
U Yes. It will signify that the current atom has a one-character representation with an immediate count as 1 Yes. It will signify that the current atom has a multi-character representation Yes. It will signify that the current atom has a one-character representation with a count greater than 1 Yes. It will signify that the current atom has a one-character representation with an immediate count as 1 Yes. It will signify that the current atom has a one-character representation with an immediate count as 1
L Yes. It signifies that the atom of which this lowercase letter is a part has a multi-character representation with an immediate count as 1 Yes. It signifies that the atom of which this lowercase letter is a part has a multi-character representation Yes. It signifies that the atom of which this lowercase letter is a part has a multi-character representation with a count greater than 1 Yes. It signifies that the atom of which this lowercase letter is a part has a multi-character representation with an immediate count as 1 Yes. It signifies that the atom of which this lowercase letter is a part has multi-character representation with immediate count as 1
D Yes. The immediate count of the current atom is greater than 1 No. A digit cannot be followed by a lowercase letter Yes. The immediate count of the current atom is greater than or equal to 10 Yes. The immediate count of the current atom is greater than 1 Yes. The immediate count of the current atom is greater than 1
( Yes. It signifies the beginning of a grouped formula No. An atom begins with a UPPERCASE LETTER No. Count cannot be allotted to a left parenthesis Yes. It signifies the beginning of a grouped formula No. A left parenthesis cannot be immediately followed by a right parenthesis
) Yes. It signifies the end of a grouped formula No. An atom begins with a UPPERCASE LETTER Yes. It signifies the end of a grouped formula followed by the count Yes. It signifies the end of a grouped formula, and the beginning of a new formula Yes. It signifies the end of two nested grouped formulas
The analysis might look a bit overwhelming, but it is important to understand the structure of a valid formula.

We can define the following skeleton to solve the problem.

To find the count of each atom in the formula, we need to scan the string formula, and extract the atoms which may be followed by certain digits representing count. We need to extract those digits and save them as the count of the atom. If no digits are there, we will take the count as 1.

The parenthesis signifies the beginning of the nested formula, which we can analyze (and add) as mentioned in the above paragraph. The count of the nested formula will be multiplied by the count of atoms in the nested formula.

Before moving further, let's emphasize the fact that for every character that we are going to scan, we need to check if it is in U, L, D, or equal to either of ( or ).

For this, we can define helper functions that will be helpful in the implementation. Click here to learn more about the helper functions.

With all tools in our hands, let's understand various ways to solve the problem.

Approach 1: Recursion

Intuition

Let's again focus on the skeleton that we defined in the Overview section.

To find the count of each atom in the formula, we need to scan the string formula, and extract the atoms which may be followed by certain digits representing count. We need to extract those digits and save them as the count of the atom. If no digits are there, we will take the count as 1.

The parenthesis signifies the beginning of the nested formula, which we can analyze (and add) as mentioned in the above paragraph. The count of the nested formula will be multiplied by the count of atoms in the nested formula.

In the second paragraph, we are calling the methodology defined in the first paragraph. In other words, the skeleton uses the skeleton itself. Is there a programming paradigm that uses the same concept?
Yes, it is called recursion.

Recursion is a programming paradigm where a function calls itself. The function solves a smaller instance of the same problem and then combines the result to solve the original problem. To avoid infinite recursion, there is a base case that stops the recursion.

To deeply understand recursion, it is advised to visit Recursion-I and Recursion-II Explore Cards.

Hence, we only need to narrow our attention to solve the non-nested formula. The nested formula will be solved using the same methodology.

Now, for parsing a non-nested formula (or recursively nested formula), we need information of the starting index of the formula. What can be the character at the starting index?

U: Yes, it should be a UPPERCASE LETTER.

L: No, an atom cannot start with a lowercase letter.

D: No, an atom cannot start with a digit.

(: Yes, it can be a left parenthesis. However, in this case, we again need to recursively parse the formula inside the parenthesis, until the corresponding right parenthesis is found.

): No, a formula cannot start with a right parenthesis. However, it is important since it signifies the end of a nested formula.

What should we return after parsing the formula?
Any data structure that stores the (atom, count) as (key, value) pair. The data structure should be able to handle multiple atoms with their counts. A dictionary in Python, HashMap in Java, or unordered_map in C++ can be used.

Let's dive more into the nitty-gritty of the implementation. Since we are using the index as the input parameter, our entire decision-making will be based on the character at the index. The character can be of five types, as defined in the Overview. Assuming our parsing is correct up to this index, the decision cases can be as follows.

U: It signifies the beginning of another atom. Thus, we need to reset our curr_atom variable in which we will save the current atom.

Before resetting, we need to check if the curr_atom is empty or not. If it is not empty, we need to save/add the count of the curr_atom in the local dictionary curr_map created for the current formula. If the variable curr_count is empty, we will take the count as 1. If it is not empty, we will take the count as curr_count.

After saving the curr_atom and curr_count in curr_map, we will reset the curr_count to an empty string and curr_atom to the current UPPERCASE LETTER.

L: It is the continuation of the current atom. We will append the lowercase letter to the curr_atom.

D: It signifies the count of the current atom. We will append the digit to the curr_count.

(: It signifies the beginning of a nested formula. We will recursively parse the formula inside the parentheses. The result of the nested formula will be added to the curr_map.

): It signifies the end of a nested formula. The last saved curr_atom and curr_count should be saved in the curr_map.

Should we return curr_map right away?
No, we need to multiply the multiplicity of the nested formula by the count of the atoms in the nested formula. For this, we will scan the digits after the right parentheses and save them in multiplier. If the multiplier is not empty, we will multiply the count of the atoms in the curr_map with the multiplier and return the curr_map.

We are not returning the index in the recursive function. However, there is a workaround. We can use a global variable index which will be updated in the recursive function. Hence, at any point in time, the index will point to the character that we are currently parsing.

We are doing recursion, so we need a base case. What can be the base case?
Well, the base case can be when the index is equal to the length of the formula. In this case, we need to save the curr_atom and curr_count in the curr_map and return the curr_map.

Additional Information: Recursive Descent Parser is a top-down parser that recursively parses the input. However, it may not be the best choice for parsing complex grammars.

If the grammar is unambiguous and the grammar is LL(1) (Left-to-right, Leftmost derivation, 1 lookahead), then a Recursive Descent Parser is a good choice.

For our formula, we can have the following grammar.

F→SF∣ϵ
S→(F)D∣AD
A→U∣UL
D→DD∣ϵ
U→A∣B∣C∣…∣Z
L→a∣b∣c∣…∣z
D→0∣1∣2∣…∣9
Here, terminals are (, ), A, B, C, …, Z, a, b, c, …, z, 0, 1, 2, …, 9.

The above grammar is Context Free Grammar (Type-2 in Chomsky Hierarchy). It can be recognized by Pushdown Automata, which uses a stack to track nested parenthesis. This fact will be mildly used in next approach.

We need to sort the map with respect to the atoms. This can be done using the built-in sorting functions of the programming language.

Finally, we need to generate the answer string. We will iterate over the sorted map and append the atom to the answer string. If the count of the atom is greater than 1, we will append the count of the atom to the answer string.

With all the information in hand, let's implement the solution.

Algorithm

Define a global variable index and set it to 0. It will be used to keep track of the current index in the formula.

Define a recursive function parse_formula() which will return a dictionary containing the count of atoms in the formula.

Define a hashmap curr_map which will store the count of atoms in the current formula.

Define two strings curr_atom and curr_count which will store the current atom and count. Both will be initialized to an empty string.

Using the global variable index, iterate over the characters of the formula.

If the character at the current index is an UPPERCASE LETTER:

Save the previous atom and count in the curr_map if it exists.

Update the curr_atom to the current UPPERCASE LETTER and curr_count to an empty string.

If the character at the current index is a lowercase letter, append the lowercase letter to the curr_atom.

If the character at the current index is a digit, append the digit to the curr_count.

If the character at the current index is a left parenthesis:

Increment the index, and parse the formula inside the parenthesis by recursively calling the parse_formula() function. Store the result in a hashmap nested_map.

Add the count of atoms in the nested_map to the curr_map.

If the character at the current index is a right parenthesis:

Save the previous atom and count in the curr_map if it exists.

Find the integer multiplier after the right parenthesis and store it in a string multiplier. If the multiplier is not empty, multiply the count of atoms in the curr_map with the multiplier.

Return the curr_map. Ensure that index points to the first non-digit character after the right parenthesis.

Before returning the curr_map, save the last atom and count in the curr_map if it exists. Return the curr_map.

Parse the formula using the parse_formula() function and store the result in final_map.

Sort the final_map with respect to the atoms (which are the keys of the map).

Generate the answer string ans by iterating over the sorted map. Append the atom to the ans. If the count of the atom is greater than 1, append the count of the atom to the ans.

Return the ans.

Implementation

Implementation Note: Let's implement the above idea slightly differently. In the code, we can see that we return the curr_map if formula[index] is ')'. This we can merge with the last return statement. Moreover, whenever we encounter a UPPERCASE LETTER, we can find corresponding lowercase letters and digits in one go.

Task: Global variables are not recommended in programming. Readers are encouraged to implement and comment below their recursive solution without using global variables.

Complexity Analysis

Let N be the length of the formula.

Time complexity: O(N
2
)

The recursive function parse_formula() will be called O(N) times.

However, we are iterating over the atoms of the nested formula to add the count to the current formula. This will take time equal to the number of atoms in the nested formula. The number of atoms in the nested formula can be equal to O(N). Thus, the time complexity of the recursive function will be O(N
2
).

One such example of worst case is (A(B(C(D(E(F(G(H(I(J(K(L(M(N(O(P(Q(R(S(T(U(V(W(X(Y(Z)2)2)2)2)2)2)2)2)2)2)2)2)2)2)2)2)2)2)2)2)2)2)2)2)2). In this case, whenever we encounter a right parenthesis, we will have to iterate over all the atoms in the nested formula to add the count to the current formula.

In actual it is O(PN) where P is the number of paranthese pairs. Here P can be at most N/2, or P=O(N). However, P is not a function of input size. Hence, we shouldn't consider it in the time complexity.

Sorting will take O(NlogN) time. This may vary depending on the implementation of the sorting algorithm in the programming language. Generating the answer string will take O(N) time.

Hence, the overall time complexity will be O(N
2
).

Space complexity: O(N)

The space complexity will be O(N) due to the space used by the recursive function call stack.

The space used by the final_map will be O(N). Moreover, we are sorting the final_map. In sorting, some extra space is used. The space complexity depends on the implementation of the sorting algorithm in the programming language, but it will be O(N).

The space used by the answer string ans will be O(N).

Hence, the overall space complexity will be O(N).

Approach 2: Stack

Intuition

The Approach 1 uses recursion to parse the formula. The recursion is a powerful tool to solve problems where the structure of the input is recursive. Recursion internally uses a stack to keep track of the function calls.

Unfolding a recursion can be done by replacing the role of the system call stack. At each occurrence of recursion, we push the parameters as a new element into the data structure that we created, instead of invoking a recursion. More details can be found in Recursion explore card

Stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle. To understand the stack in depth, it is advised to visit Stack explore card.

In this approach, we will unfold the recursion using a stack. Instead of making a recursive call to parse the formula inside the parenthesis, we will use a stack to keep track of the atoms and their counts of the nested formula. The result of the nested formula will be added to the current formula (which itself may be a nested formula for some other formula).

Hence, in the stack, our initial top element would be an empty hashmap. It will store the final count of atoms in the formula.

We will populate the hashmap as we parse the formula. When we encounter a left parenthesis, we will push another empty hashmap to the stack. It will store the count of atoms in the nested formula. When we encounter the corresponding right parenthesis, we will pop the top element from the stack, multiply the count with the multiplicity of the nested formula, and add the count to the current formula (which would then be on the top of the stack).

Since each left parenthesis will have a corresponding right parenthesis, in the end, the stack will have only one element (which we pushed initially). This element will contain the total count of atoms in the formula.

Additional Information: As mentioned in the intuition of Approach 1, the grammar of the formula can be recognized by Pushdown Automata, which uses a stack. Hence, this approach is inspired by pushdown automata.

The following animation visualizes the intuition for the input "Na2ZnRb5(PuS11(SH)6W)2(H2S)Unu8Pu"

Current

Readers are encouraged to implement the solution on their own.

Algorithm

Initialize a stack stack. The top element of the stack will be an empty hashmap. It will store the count of atoms in the formula.

Initialize the integer index to 0. It will keep track of the current character in the formula.

Iterate over the characters of the formula using the index index.

If the character at the current index is a left parenthesis, push an empty hashmap to the stack. It will store the count of atoms in the nested formula.

If the character at the current index is a right parenthesis, pop the top element from the stack.

Find the multiplier after the right parenthesis and store it in multiplier. If the multiplier is not empty, multiply the count of atoms in the popped hashmap with the multiplier.

Add the count of atoms in the popped hashmap to the hashmap which is on the top of the stack.

Otherwise, it should be a UPPERCASE LETTER. Extract the complete atom with frequency and add it to the hashmap which is on the top of the stack.

Sort the hashmap which is on the top of the stack using the keys.

Generate the answer string ans by iterating over the sorted hashmap. Append the atom to the ans. If the count of the atom is greater than 1, append the count of the atom to the ans.

Return the ans.

Implementation

Complexity Analysis

Let N be the length of the formula.

Time complexity: O(N
2
)

The stack will have at most O(N) elements. Each element will be popped and pushed at most once. However, since we need to revisit the atoms in the nested formula to add the count to the current formula, in the worst case, the time complexity of the stack operations will be O(N
2
).

Sorting will take O(NlogN) time. This may vary depending on the implementation of the sorting algorithm in the programming language. Generating the answer string will take O(N) time.

Hence, the overall time complexity will be O(N
2
).

Space complexity: O(N)

The space used by the stack will be O(N).

The space used by the final_map will be O(N). Moreover, we are sorting the final_map. In sorting, some extra space is used. The space complexity depends on the implementation of the sorting algorithm in the programming language. However, it will be O(N).

The space used by the answer string ans will be O(N).

Hence, the overall space complexity will be O(N).

Approach 3: Regular Expression

Intuition

In this problem, we are parsing a string to extract the atoms and their counts. Parsing is often associated with regular expressions. Regular expressions are a powerful tool to match patterns in strings.

Regular Expression is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. It is used to match character combinations in strings. To understand regular expressions in depth, readers can solve Regular Expression Matching problem.

To understand the regular expression more formally, readers can visit Wikipedia

Let's understand a few examples of regular expressions used in daily life.

Dates can be matched using regular expressions. For example, a date in the format mm/dd/yyyy can be matched using the regular expression (0[1-9]|1[0-2])/(0[1-9]|[12][0-9]|3[01])/\d{4}.

(0[1-9] | 1[0-2]) signifies the month should be between 01 and 12. It briefly lists 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09, 10, 11, and 12. The | signifies logical OR.

(0[1-9] | [12][0-9] | 3[01]) signifies the day should be between 01 and 31. It briefly lists 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20,

\d{4} signifies the year should be a 4-digit number. The \d is used to match a digit, and {4} is used to convey that there should be exactly 4 digits.

Phone Numbers can be matched using regular expressions. For example, a phone number in the format xxx-xxx-xxxx can be matched using the regular expression \d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}.

Emails can be validated using ^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$ - To ensure a strong password we can use ^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[@$!%*?&])[A-Za-z\d@$!%*?&]{8,}$. It will ensure that the password should have at least 8 characters, one UPPERCASE letter, one lowercase letter, one digit, and one special character.

It is worth noting that in different programming languages, the syntax of regular expressions can vary. Hence, it is strongly advised to visit the official documentation of the programming language. Scroll down to implementation for language-specific notes.

How is regular expression relevant to this problem?

The atom along with its count is a regular expression

It begins with an UPPERCASE LETTER,
Followed by zero or more lowercase letters,
Followed by zero or more digits.
The regular expression will be UL
∗
D
∗
. In code, it will be [A-Z][a-z]*\d*. Hence, we can extract the atom and their count using this regular expression.

Since we want atoms and count separately, we will use two tuples. The first tuple will contain the atom and the second tuple will contain the count. It will be ([A-Z][a-z]*)(\d*).

However, we didn't take into account the nestedness. For that, let's extract the parenthesis as well.

The regular expression for the left parenthesis will be (.
The regular expression for the right parenthesis followed by the multiplier will be ())(\d*). The grouping ensures that we can extract the multiplier separately.
Hence, we can scan these five entities (atom, count, left parenthesis, right parenthesis, and multiplier) in the formula using regular expressions.

As done in stack approach, whenever we encounter a left parenthesis, we will push an empty hashmap to the stack. Whenever we encounter a right parenthesis, we will pop the top element from the stack, multiply the count with the multiplicity of the nested formula, and add the count to the current formula (which would then be on the top of the stack).

Additional Information: In Approach 1, we mentioned that formula can be represented using Context Free Grammar (CFG).

In this approach we are using regular expressions to parse the formula. Regular expressions can be represented using Regular Grammar.

Regular Grammar (Type-3) is a subset of CFG (Type-2). It is less expressive than CFG. For CFG, we have pushdown automata, while for Regular Grammar, we have finite automata.

We are using stack, then how is it different from Approach 2?
In this approach, we won't be manually extracting atoms and counts, it will be done using regular expressions. We will be using stack only to ensure that the nested formula gets multiplied with the correct multiplicity.

Algorithm

Define a regular expression regex to extract the atom, count, left parenthesis, right parenthesis, and corresponding multiplier as quintuples. Deep dive into the documentation of your preferred programming language to formulate the required regular expression.

Using regex, find all the occurrences of the quintuples in the formula. Store the result in matcher.

Initialize a stack stack to keep track of the atoms and their counts. The top element of the stack will be an empty hashmap. It will store the count of atoms in the formula.

The more the distance of the top element is from the bottom element, the more nested the formula is.

Iterate over all the quintuples (atom, count, left, right, multiplier) in the parsed formula using the matcher.

If the atom is not empty, then add it to the top hashmap of the stack. If the count is empty, the corresponding value will be incremented by 1. Otherwise, the corresponding value will be incremented by the count.

Else if the left is not empty, push an empty hashmap to the stack. It signifies the beginning of a nested formula.

Else if the right is not empty, pop the top element as curr_map from the stack. If the multiplier is not empty, multiply the count of atoms in the curr_map with the multiplier.

Add the count of atoms in the curr_map to the hashmap which is on the top of the stack.

Sort the hashmap which is on the top of stack using the keys.

Generate the answer string ans by iterating over the sorted hashmap. Append the atom to the ans. If the count of the atom is greater than 1, append the count of the atom to the ans.

Return the ans.

Implementation

Implementation Note: Ensure that the regular expression is correct, and doesn't include any extra spaces. Moreover, it is strongly advised to visit the official documentation to understand the nitty-gritty of regular expressions in the programming language.

For Python, readers can visit the documentation of re module.
For Java, readers can visit the documentation of Pattern class.
For C++, readers can visit documentation of regex library.
Complexity Analysis

Let N be the length of the formula.

Time complexity: O(N
2
)

Parsing the regex in the formula will take O(N) time.

There will be at most O(N) quintuples in the matcher. Now, since for the right parenthesis, we need to revisit the atoms in the nested formula to add the count to the current formula, in the worst case, the time complexity of the stack operations will be O(N
2
).

Sorting will take O(NlogN) time. This may vary depending on the implementation of the sorting algorithm in the programming language.

Generating the answer string will take O(N) time.

Hence, the overall time complexity will be O(N
2
).

Space complexity: O(N)

There will be at most O(N) quintuples in the matcher.

The space used by the stack will be O(N).

The space used by the final_map will be O(N). Moreover, we are sorting the final_map. In sorting, some extra space is used. The space complexity depends on the implementation of the sorting algorithm in the programming language. However, it will be O(N).

The space used by the answer string ans will be O(N).

Hence, the overall space complexity will be O(N).

Approach 4: Reverse Scanning

Intuition

In all the approaches we have discussed so far, whenever we encounter a right parenthesis, we need to traverse backward (in a way) to ensure that multiplicity is applied to the atoms in the nested formula.

This is primarily because we get to know about the multiplicity of the nested formula only after the end of the nested formula. Hence, we need to revisit the atoms in the nested formula to apply the multiplicity.

What if we could know the multiplicity of the nested formula in the beginning itself?
Then we can apply the multiplicity to the atoms as we parse them. This will eliminate the need to revisit the atoms in the nested formula.

How can we know the multiplicity of the nested formula in the beginning itself?
By traversing right-to-left, we can know the multiplicity of the nested formula in the beginning itself.

As soon as we encounter a number followed by a right parenthesis, we can store the multiplicity.
(Note that number followed by lowercase letter will be count, and not multiplicity)

However, what if we encounter a left parenthesis?
Then the most recent multiplicity will cease to exist. Accessing the most recent element can be done using the Last-in-First-Out (LIFO) principle. Hence, we can use a stack to store the multiplicity.

To fasten the process, we can use an integer multiplier to store the current multiplier, which will be the product of all the multipliers in the stack. Initially, the multiplier will be 1.

On encountering ), we need to multiply the multiplier with the just scanned multiplier.
On encountering (, we need to divide the multiplier by the popped element from the stack.
Readers are encouraged to implement the solution on their own. Plan all the cases that we need to take care of while scanning from right to left.

It is worth noting that for forming atoms and count, we won't "append" the characters. Instead, we will "prepend" the characters. This is because we are scanning the formula in reverse. Moreover, a UPPERCASE LETTER signifies the end of the scanning of the atom and not the beginning.

Algorithm

Initialize the integer running_mul to 1. It will store the valid multiplier for atoms to be scanned.

Initialize the stack stack to store the multipliers. Push 1 to the stack. The product of elements in the stack will be the valid multiplier for atoms to be scanned, which is also stored in running_mul.

Initialize the hashmap final_map to store the count of atoms.

Initialize the strings curr_atom and curr_count to store the current atom and count.

Traverse right-to-left in the formula using the iterator index.

If the character at the current index is a digit, prepend it to the curr_count.

If the character at the current index is a lowercase letter, prepend it to the curr_atom.

If the character at the current index is an UPPERCASE LETTER, prepend it to the curr_atom. Now, the curr_atom is complete.

Add the curr_atom to the final_map. If the curr_count is not empty, the value of the curr_atom will be the product of curr_count and running_mul. Otherwise, the value of the curr_atom will be running_mul.

Reset the curr_atom and curr_count.

If the character at the current index is a right parenthesis, the curr_count, if any, will be considered as curr_multiplier. If curr_count is empty, curr_multiplier will be 1.

Push the curr_multiplier to the stack.

Multiply the running_mul by the curr_multiplier.

Reset the curr_count.

If the character at the current index is a left parenthesis, divide the running_mul by the popped element from the stack.

Sort the final_map using the keys.

Generate the answer string ans by iterating over the sorted final_map. Append the atom to the ans. If the count of the atom is greater than 1, append the count of the atom to the ans.

Return the ans.

Implementation

Complexity Analysis

Let N be the length of the formula.

Time complexity: O(N
2
)

Declaring and Initializing the variables before the while loop will take O(1) time.

The while loop will run O(N) times. The number of steps in one while loop depends on the character at the current index.

In the case of a digit, lowercase letter, or UPPERCASE LETTER, we are prepending the characters. Appending is O(1) operation, however, prepending is O(N) operation.

s = s + a is different from s = a + s. The former can be augmented as s += a, while the latter can't be augmented.

Although it may vary with programming language, in general, inserting at the end is O(1) operation, while inserting at the beginning is O(N) operation.

The worst case example of this can be when the formula is "Qabcdefghij".

In the case of the left parenthesis, we are converting the string curr_count to integer curr_multiplier. This may take O(N) time in the worst case. However, the amortized time complexity will be O(1).

In the case of the right parenthesis, we are updating the running_mul and stack. This will take O(1) time.

Hence, the time complexity of the while loop will be O(N
2
).

Sorting will take O(NlogN) time. This may vary depending on the implementation of the sorting algorithm in the programming language.

Generating the answer string will take O(N) time.

Hence, the overall time complexity will be O(N
2
).

Space complexity: O(N)

The stack may have at most O(N) elements.

The space used by the final_map will be O(N). Moreover, we are sorting the final_map. In sorting, some extra space is used. The space complexity depends on the implementation of the sorting algorithm in the programming language. However, it will be O(N).

The space used by the ans will be O(N).

The space used by the curr_atom and curr_count will be O(N).

The space used by the running_mul will be O(1), since it is of integer type, which allocates fixed space.

Hence, the overall space complexity will be O(N).

Approach 5: Preprocessing

Intuition

In previous approach, the bottleneck in the while loop (as mentioned in the complexity analysis section) was

Prepending the characters to curr_atom and curr_count was taking O(N) time.

The alternative is to NOT prepend the characters. Instead, we can append the characters and reverse the string before using it. Since there will be at most O(N) characters in the string, reversing the string will take O(N) time. However, the amortized time complexity will be O(1). Readers are encouraged to implement the solution on their own and comment their implementation below.

In this approach, we will pre-process the formula to make the left-to-right parsing easier. For every index, we will store the valid multiplier beforehand.

Pre-processing is a common technique to make the actual processing easier.

As done in Approach 4, we will use a stack to store the multipliers.
We can use another array muls to store the valid multiplier for every index. After this pre-processing, we can traverse the formula left-to-right, and apply the multiplier to the atoms as we scan them. During left-to-right traversal, we can append the characters to curr_atom and curr_count, which is a constant time operation.

Let's see if it helps in optimizing the runtime.

Algorithm

Initialize the array muls to store the valid multiplier for every index. Initialize the integer running_mul to 1. It will store the valid multiplier for atoms to be scanned.

Initialize the stack stack to store the multipliers. Push 1 to the stack. The product of elements in the stack will be the valid multiplier for atoms to be scanned, which is also stored in running_mul.

Initialize the empty string curr_number to store the current number.

Do the pre-processing by traversing right-to-left in the formula using the iterator index, which is initialized to the formula.length() - 1.

If the character at the current index is a digit, append it to the curr_number.

If the character at the current index is a letter, it means the scanned number was count and not a multiplier. Discard the curr_number.

If the character at the current index is a right parenthesis, the scanned number was multiplier. However, it was scanned in reverse.

If curr_number is not empty, reverse it and convert it to an integer in the variable curr_multiplier. If it was empty, curr_multiplier will be 1.

Multiply the running_mul by the curr_multiplier.

Push the curr_multiplier to the stack.

Reset the curr_number.

If the character at the current index is a left parenthesis, the most recent multiplier will cease to exist. Hence, divide the running_mul by the popped element from the stack. Moreover, reset the curr_number.

Append the running_mul to the muls.

Reverse the muls.

Initialize the hashmap final_map to store the count of atoms.

Process the formula left-to-right using the iterator index, which is initialized to 0.

If the character at the current index is a UPPERCASE LETTER, extract the entire atom and count (which by default should be 1). Add into the final_map the atom and count, multiplied by the valid multiplier at the current index.

Sort the final_map using the keys.

Generate the answer string ans by iterating over the sorted final_map. Append the atom to the ans. If the count of the atom is greater than 1, append the count of the atom to the ans.

Return the ans.

Here's how muls should look like for the input "K4(ON(SO3)2)2". The only values of muls we ultimately care about are

On the last letter of the atom, if there is no associated number.
On the last number of the digit followed by an atom.
The remaining values are intermediate values that helped us in producing the values we care about.

Implementation

Implementation Note: In the above implementation

We are reversing a string curr_number
We are converting variables curr_number and curr_count to integer.
We can avoid both of these if we form integers from characters as we scan them. This will need a little bit of Mathematics. Readers are encouraged to implement the solution on their own and comment their implementation below.

Complexity Analysis

Let N be the length of the formula.

Time complexity: O(NlogN)

The while loop of pre-processing will have O(N) iterations.

When the current character is alphanumeric, or left parenthesis, the time complexity will be O(1).

When the current character is a right parenthesis, the time complexity can be O(N) in the worst case, because of the string reversal and conversion to integer. However, the amortized time complexity will be O(1).

Hence, the time complexity of pre-processing will be O(N).

Reversing the muls will take O(N) time.

The while loop of the processing will have O(N) iterations.

Every character will be processed at most twice, once during extracting, and other during storing.

Hence, the time complexity of the processing will be O(N).

Sorting will take O(KlogK) time, where K is the number of unique atoms. In the worst case, K can be equal to N. It is worth noting that this may vary depending on the implementation of the sorting algorithm in the programming language.

Generating the answer string will take O(N) time.

Hence, the overall time complexity will be O(N+N+NlogN+N), which is O(NlogN).

Space complexity: O(N)

The space used by the muls will be O(N).

The space used by the stack will be O(N).

The space used by the final_map will be O(N). Moreover, we are sorting the final_map. In sorting, some extra space is used. The space complexity depends on the implementation of the sorting algorithm in the programming language. However, it will be O(N).

The space used by the answer string ans will be O(N).

Hence, the overall space complexity will be O(N).

Approach 6: Reverse Scanning with Regex

Intuition

In Approach-4, the bottleneck in the while loop (as mentioned in the complexity analysis section) was

Prepending the characters to curr_atom and curr_count was taking O(N) time.

The purpose of prepending was to extract atoms and count. However, we have seen in Approach 3 that regular expressions can be used to extract atoms and counts.

After extracting the atoms and counts, we can do reverse scanning to ensure that in each nested formula, the atoms are multiplied by the correct multiplicity. This approach is inspired by the same thought process.

We have achieved O(NlogN) time complexity in Approach 5. Can we do better than this?
Practically, it is difficult to achieve better time complexity than O(NlogN), because sorting will take at least O(NlogN) time. Since we have to sort the strings, the non-comparison based sorting algorithms (counting sort, radix sort, bucket sort) can't be used.

Readers are encouraged to implement the solution on their own. It will be a combination of Approach 3 and Approach 4, but somewhat concise and optimized.

Algorithm

Define a regular expression regex to extract the atom, count, left parenthesis, right parenthesis, and corresponding multiplier as quintuples. Deep dive into the documentation of your preferred programming language to formulate the required regular expression.

Using regex, find all the occurrences of the quintuples in the formula. Store the result in matcher, and reverse it.

Initialize the hashmap final_map to store the count of atoms.

Initialize the stack stack to keep track of the nested multiplicities. Push integer 1 to the stack.

Initialize the integer running_mul to 1. It will store the valid multiplier for atoms to be scanned.

Parse the formula by iterating over the matcher.

If the current element is an atom, add it to the final_map.

The value will be the product of the count and the running_mul. If the count is not present, the value will be 1 * running_mul.

If the current element is a right parenthesis.

If the multiplier is present, multiply the running_mul by the multiplier. Push the multiplier to the stack.

If the multiplier is not present, push 1 to the stack.

If the current element is a left parenthesis, divide the running_mul by the popped element from the stack.

Sort the final_map using the keys.

Generate the answer string ans by iterating over the sorted final_map. Append the atom to the ans. If the count of the atom is greater than 1, append the count of the atom to the ans.

Return the ans.
